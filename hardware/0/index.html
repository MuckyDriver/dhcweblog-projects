                        The purpose of this hardware project is for me to build a computer within or around a certain budget. In this case I gave myself the
                        budget of £200. I will go through exactly how I built the computer showing you the steps I did using pictures. The computer includes legacy hardware
                        and new ones.

                        Before I started the building of the computer I made sure I had all parts I needed. I laid them all out on the table where
                        the computer was going to be built. I put a non-static cloth on the table to make sure the computer parts don't get damaged as easily. In addition to that
                        I made sure I had scissors and most importantly the screwdriver which allows me to put things together.

                                <p>
                                    First thing I did was to put the components to go onto the motherboard first before it was put in the computer case.
                                    The components I got ready for this were the CPU, CPU Cooler and the RAM. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>The motherboard itself is brand new
                                    so it should be in all working order. The CPU was second hand from a website called CeX, same goes for the RAM. The CPU
                                    Cooler in addition to the motherboard was brand new from Amazon.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    The RAM was very easy to install as it only required to be slotted into place and I knew this when it made
                                    two clicking sounds to let me know it was securely in. At the time of doing this I was not aware that the memory I 
                                    got from CeX was faulty and did not work. So instead after discovering this I found an old pair of 16GB RAM sticks to put 
                                    in instead and obviously those worked.
                                </p>
                                
                                <br><h4>CPU</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The processor was slightly damaged as well, one of the pins was bent. I had to use something to bend it back into place 
                                    so it would fit into the motherboard cpu socket. I knew it was in properly went it laid flat in the socket. Before I knew the RAM was 
                                    faulty I did think the CPU was at fault since the PC in testing phase did not turn and thought the pin was beyond repair. However I know 
                                    now the CPU works fine including the graphics.
                                </p>
                                
                                <br><h4>CPU Cooler</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The cooler was really simple to install. All I had to was rotate in the right direction to fit in 4 screws for it to be 
                                    tightened in so it was loose. Then proceeded to plug it into the motherboard.

                                    The SSD I chose was a SATA SSD which uses a SATA cable rather than slotting it into the motherboard. Read/Write speeds are not 
                                    so important in this build. Got everything I need to secure the SSD to the PC Case which included a screwdriver and screws which came
                                    with the PC Case. 
                                </p>

                                    I installed the SSD on the bottom of the PC Case - there was a place for it on the front panel of the case but it was too

                                    The motherboard was easily secured to the pc case without any issues and with plenty of room to screw it in. The motherboard did take some
                                    time to get secure so it did not wiggle about so the screws were done up quite tight.

                                    The installation of the power supply was quite simple. A bigger pc case would usually have the PSU located at the bottom 
                                    of the case however since this one is built different for its size it was installed on the top of the case. The PSU required 4 
                                    screws to keep it securely in place.

                                <p>
                                    These goddamn cables! The power supply I got was not modular in any way because I was on a very small budget. 
                                    Later in the project I did find a better way to make the cables look sort of managed. At this point of the computer build I had 
                                    plugged all the cables into their designated ports.
                                </p>

                                    Additionally, some reason the USB 3.0 cable port got damaged however after some research it's a common problem in some motherboards
                                    allowing the safety plastic from staying on the motherboard.

                                    This marks the first day of building the computer - I had to split this up into two different days because I thought I needed a

                                    First thing I did on the second day of the computer build, I connected the SATA SSD to the motherboard. For some reason I didn't know 
                                    I had to plug the SATA SSD into the power supply so that had to be done after I tested the computer. Getting into the BIOS did not require
                                    a storage component.

                                    I found a way to tidy up the cables the best I can. I fed the cables through the front of the case where it 
                                    did not get in the way and fitted well without stretching the cables too much.

                                    The graphics card I had purchased originally for this machine was too big to fit inside the computer case.
                                    However I also discovered the computer case was way too small for any graphics card to begin with. Next time I do a project 
                                    like this I will make sure I get a normal mid-tower case.

                                    The computer is now fully built and is ready to be tested. In this project all I have to do is test if I can get into the

                                    Booting into the BIOS was successfull and everything seems to be registered correctly. Additionally I checked the that the fans were

                            In the end I was able to build a functional computer close to the budget I had set out for myself. There are a few issues I had along the way such
                            as the CPU had bent pins that I had to bend back into place, RAM I ordered was not working at all so I had to replace it for one of mine. 
                            The graphics card was too big for the case so next time in the future this computer could get an upgrade if I get a bigger case. 
                            The budget was originally supposed to be £100.00 but as I found out it would have been nearly impossible to get something to work on modern parts 
                            and operating systems.

                            I hope to do more of these kinds of projects in the future, and now I know more about building computers it will become easier the more I practice.
                            This computer may have an upgrade to improve the cable management and to possibly get that graphics card installed.
